# nodejs-boilerplate

Just a NodeJS boilerplate for my personal use. I created this so I can use this in small projects that I use to make my life easier.

## Installation
`<project-name>` is project folder name

```
git clone git@github.com:tsachit/nodejs-boilerplate.git <project-name>
```


#### Run this command to setup server
```
npm run setup
```

#### Just incase if the setup script doesn't work for you. Do these things manually.

- delete package-lock.json
- delete node_modules
- change `package.json` according to your desire.
- run "npm install"
- delete `.git` folder(so you can setup your own git)

#### You can now delete setup.js.

Feel free to ping me if this script does work for you

Thanks ðŸ˜Ž
